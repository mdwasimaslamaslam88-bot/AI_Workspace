| ASTER-STATE-MERGE-001 | COMPLETE | none |  |
| ASTER-RUNTIME-PROVENANCE-001 | FAILED | ASTER-STATE-MERGE-001 | Child identity or trusted parent verification failed; do not promote the task. |
| ASTER-RELEASE-VALIDATION-001 | PENDING | ASTER-RUNTIME-PROVENANCE-001 | Application source changed from 2e7b587490625139d38e59e1e534b896ad3f39dc to 3caaf7abae882b0d83db679ce80d56def1da1a00; current-source evidence must be recaptured. |
| ASTER-CANONICAL-CODER-001 | BLOCKED_EXTERNAL | none | All configured candidates are rejected or acquisition-blocked; a new eligible verified model/digest is required. |
| ASTER-REVERSE-CALLBACK-001 | BLOCKED_EXTERNAL | none | The supported parent MCP/reverse callback endpoint rejects the available credential or is unavailable. |
| ASTER-DEX-001 | BLOCKED_EXTERNAL | none | The host sandbox denies the required network namespace operation (RTM_NEWADDR/EPERM). |
| ASTER-VOICE-001 | BLOCKED_EXTERNAL | none | Stable provider/hardware behavior for the remaining acoustic/model variance is unavailable. |

The issue queue and machine-readable controller state are authoritative. A child model response cannot mark an issue complete without objective evidence.

Next prompt is persisted at `/home/md-wasim/AI_Workspace_Data/aster-evidence/current_state.json` and is generated from the selected issue and observed evidence.
